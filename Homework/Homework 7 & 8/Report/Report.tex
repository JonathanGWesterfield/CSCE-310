\section{FileMgr.java}
    Attached is a version of FileMgr.java where I added instrumentation 
    to track the number of block reads and writes, accessor methods for 
    these values and methods to reset them. Use your ninja Java skills 
    to modify the methods \textit{commit()} and \textit{rollback()} in 
    the class \textit{Transaction} 
    (in \textit{simpledb.remote}) to print these statistics—note: you will need to 
    get the \textit{FileMgr} object using the static method \textit{SimpleDB.fileMgr()} in
    \textit{simpledb.server}. Reset the counts when you print them. Start the 
    SimpleDB server and run the client program \textit{StudentMajor.java}. Turn-in
    a copy of the output for the server console and explain the counts 
    printed and the counts output for the client program. Also, turn-in a 
    hardcopy of your modifications to Transaction.

\section{SimpleDB Block Size}
    Assume the SimpleDB block size of 400 given in class Page and that records
    cannot span blocks. Show the calculation for the maximum number of records
    that will fit in a SimpleDB record page and the amount of wasted 
    (fragmented) space in the page for each of the following record sizes
    given in bytes: 20, 50 and 100 (don’t forget to include the 4-byte 
    empty/in-use flag for each record). Also, explain how a SimpleDB record 
    file can have a block with no records in it.
    \\
    \\
    For 20 byte records: \(400 mod(20 + 4)=16\) bytes wasted.\\
    For 50 byte records: \(400 mod(50 + 4)=22\) bytes wasted.\\
    For 100 byte records: \(400 mod(100 + 4)=88\) bytes wasted.\\
    \\
    A SimpleDB record file might have a block with no records in it if
    the \textit{appendBlock()} function is called erroneously or if we
    have just created a new block because the last block was full. 
    This new block has not had anything inserted into it yet.


\section{Transaction T}
    Consider the following scenario: Transaction T deletes a record from a
    block, setting a record’s flag to EMPTY. Transaction U inserts a 
    record into the block and the slot where the previously deleted 
    record is picked to hold the new record, setting its flag to INUSE. 
    Transaction U also writes new values into the fields of the new record. 
    Transaction T rolls back. Since the old values of the deleted record 
    were not saved in the log, the record cannot be restored to its original 
    value—ugh! a) Explain why this scenario cannot happen in SimpleDB. 
    b) If the transactions T and U attempt to perform the above steps, what 
    actually happens in SimpleDB?

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item This can't occur in SimpleDB because the log file logs every
            change to the database, including what what values were modified
            from and to. Therefore, if a value was changed from \textit{v}
            to \textit{z}, the log file will contain both of those values at
            that sequence indicating that a change was made.
        \item The log file has logs of every single change that was made to 
            the database. These changes are stored in log records that are 
            written in the form of a log file. This means that the log file
            will contain the following information below:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Start Transaction \textit{T}.
                \item Database element \textit{X} was modified and used 
                    to contain the value \textit{v}, but is now empty.
                \item Commit Transaction \textit{T}.
            \end{itemize}

            If Transaction \textit{T} is rolled back, the recovery manager will
            use the log file to find the corresponding step that contains the 
            old value and put the old value back into \textit{v}. Undo logging 
            will also just write new logs instead of removing logs that were
            “undone".
    \end{enumerate}


\section{LogMgr.iterator}
    The code for LogMgr.iterator calls flush(). Explain why this call is 
    necessary, or not. Here is the code in question.

    \begin{verbatim}
        public synchronized Iterator<BasicLogRecord> iterator() {
            flush();
            return new LogIterator(currentblk);
        }
        private void flush() {
            mypage.write(currentblk);
        }
    \end{verbatim}
    IS THE CALL TO flush() NECESSARY? Explain your answer.
    \\
    \\
    Yes. The call to \textit{flush()} is necessary. Since we are trying
    to get a log of all of the transactions from the database, we need
    to call \textit{flush()} in order to make sure that any log actions
    that haven't been written to disk are forced onto the disk. This 
    needs to be done if we are currently in the middle of a transaction
    since there are operations we need to keep track of the make sure
    we don't lose information.


\section{SimpleDB Log Manager}
    The SimpleDB log manager implements the LSN of a log record as its 
    block number in the log file.

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Explain why this implementation of LSN does not uniquely
            identify the log records.
            \\\\
            This implementation does not uniquely identify the log
            records because all log records in a block have the same
            LSN.
        \item Explain why this implementation may cause the method 
            \textit{LogMgr.flush()} to unnecessarily write the log manager’s page 
            to disk.
            \\\\
            This implementation can cause an unnecessary write to the
            disk because there is no checking if there has been any 
            addition to the page. This will cause a page to be written
            to the disk even if there were no changes made since we 
            can't distinguish between any records in the page.
        \item Modify the code (and the implementation of an LSN) so that
            the page is written to disk only if absolutely necessary. 
            Turn-in a hardcopy of your code changes.

                \caption{First I modified the \textit{flush()} function to use the block hash to 
                    see if any changes were even made to the block.}

            \end{figure}
            \\
            \begin{figure}[htp]
                \centering

                \label{fig:logmgr2}
            \end{figure}
        \item How do you know if the code works? See if you can design 
            an experiment using the code you wrote for problem 1 above
            to prove that your modified code improves operation of the 
            log manager. Turn in your experiment and the output results 
            with an explanation.
            \\\\
            We know that our code works because we can explicitly see from the
            figure below that we did not flush since there were no blocks being
            written. Otherwise, the code would just flush despite there being
            no changes in our blocks.

\section{Textbook Exercise 17.1.2, p. 851, Part b.}
    For each of the transactions of Exercise 17.1.1, add the read and 
    write-actions to the computations and show the effect of the steps 
    on main memory and disk. Assume that initially A = 5 and B = 10. Also,
    tell whether it is possible, with the appropriate order of OUTPUT
    actions, to assure that consistency is preserved even if there is 
    a crash while the transaction is executing.
    \begin{table}[htp]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
            Action      & \textit{t}  & Mem A & Mem B & Disk A & Disk B \\
            \hline
            Read(B, \textit{t})  & 10 &       & 10    & 5      & 10     \\
            Read(A, \textit{t})  & 5  & 5     & 10    & 5      & 10     \\
            \textit{t} := A + B  & 15 & 5     & 10    & 5      & 10     \\
            Write(B, \textit{t}) & 15 & 5     & 15    & 5      & 10     \\
            \textit{t} := A + B  & 20 & 5     & 15    & 5      & 10     \\
            Write(A, \textit{t}) & 20 & 20    & 15    & 5      & 10     \\
            OUTPUT(B)   & 15 & 20    & 15    & 5      & 15     \\
            OUTPUT(A)   & 20 & 20    & 15    & 20     & 15     \\      
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    \\
    This Transaction does NOT maintain consistency in the table. No 
    ordering of the OUTPUT actions will assure consistency since the
    transaction breaks consistency in the first place based on the 
    rule 0 $\leq$ \textit{A} $\leq$ \textit{B}. The only way consistency
    would be preserved is if the transaction crashed when calculating 
    \textit{A}. Then \textit{B} would still be greater than \textit{A}.


\section{Project Problem}
    The goal of this problem is to modify the Games collection by adding
    the corresponding player\_name to each game document. A game document
    contains the player\_id of the corresponding Profile document, but we
    want to add the player\_name from the Profile document to the game
    document. You can solve this problem two ways—via shell commands, or 
    a custom Java program. You decide. As proof of the success of your 
    solution turn in the output of a shell query on the games collection 
    using the player\_name (not the player\_id) that returns a count of the 
    documents in the Games collection for each of the players, “Tom Brady ”, 
    “Terry Bradshaw” and “Jim Brown”. Submit any java code to ecampus as 
    part of your ZIP file. You do not have to turn in a hard-copy of your 
    java code. If you solve it via shell commands, turn in a hardcopy of 
    the console output from running the commands.
