Exam 1 Review

Types of Questions:
	Given a schema and some SQL, write the query output
	Explain the output difference givent 2 queries and a schema
	Describe what a query does
	Write SQL given a query tree
	Write SQL to do stuff
	All of the above for relational algebra
	Make chages to an ERD
	Write a JDBC program

What to study:
	Terminology sheets
	Slides
	Homework Problems (Especially the relational Algebra)
	Quizzes
	Coding Examples
	Textbook DB examples

ACID Properties
	Transaction management
	Atomicity
		either all the changes or none of them are made to the database
	Consistency
		Transaction must perserve consistency contraints of the database
	Isolation
		The result must be "as if" the transaction ran alone
	Durability
		Once transaction has completed, changes must not be lost

Chapter 2
	Relational Data Model
	Table structure, fiedl types, null values, keys and foreign keys, constraints & table creation in SQL
	Relational Algebra, operators
	Derby Examples

Chapter 3
	A relation should contain only one "concept", or it has duplicate data!
	Find functional dependencies stemming from the presence of multiple concepts (entities in a schema)
	Normalization
		Split the relation into multiple relations each containing one concept (normality)
			All of the original data is represented
			Eliminates anomalies

Chapter 4
	Data Models
		ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
		UML (Unified Modeling Language)
		Crows Foot
	Is-a relationships and subclasses
	Diagramming weak and strong entities
	Converting diagrams into Relational Schemas

Chapter 5 & 6
	Relational Algebra on Bags
	SQL query clauses
	Updating Tables
	Views
	Query Trees

Chapter 7 (Kinds of constraints)
	Key
		Implements a uniqueness constraint
	Foreign-key
		Implements referential integrity
	Value-based, or domain constriants
		Constran values of a particular attribute
	Tuple-based constraint
		specify requried relationship
	Assertions
		Specifies an inter-relational constraint as a boolean expression
	Triggers
		Event-condition-actions

Chapter 8
	Data redundancy to improve query performance
	Denormalization
	Indexes
		Record identifiers
	Maintenance costs

Chapter 9
	JDBC functionality
	Five JDBC interfaces
		Driver
		Connection
		Statemnet
		ResultSet
		ResultSetMetaData
	How to get a driver
	Driver class
		simpleDB = simpleDriver
		Mariadb = Driver
		MySQL = ConnectorJ
	Java.sql
